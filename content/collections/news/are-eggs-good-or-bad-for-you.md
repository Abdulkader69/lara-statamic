And, of course, simply boiling, frying, scrambling or poaching them on their own yields delicious results too. But for all their versatility, eggs do have some downsides. Here’s a breakdown of almost everything you should know about eggs, along with whether they really are good or bad.'

        text: 'In the 1950s and 60s, in response to the ever-growing demand for eggs, cage egg farming began to take place around the world. Factories were designed to churn out as many eggs as possible for as little cost, and this often meant confining too many hens in tightly-packed cages that restrict almost all movement, causing various health problems such as feather loss and brittle bones, as well as giving them mental distress. Needless to say, this type of intensive farming is unethical and also pretty bad for the environment. The prime problem of the latter lies with the ingredients of conventional hen feed, which are mostly made of cereal grains that require a vast swath of land to cultivate and have contributed to deforestation.'

Beware that some of these labels can be confusing, while others could include misleading terms. It’s always worth doing some research into each type if you want to find the best egg for you, and one that actually has animal welfare and sustainability at its heart – factors that are becoming ever more important for conscious egg consumers.'

They are also low in calories, with an average egg containing around 78, making them an excellent choice for a light and nutritious meal or snack.'

        text: 'One caveat of eggs, many would argue, is their cholesterol content. Cholesterol is a fatty substance that can build up in the blood vessels and increase the risk of heart attacks and stroke, and each egg yolk contains about 185 milligrams of cholesterol, which is more than half the US daily recommended amount. This has led to some fears that eggs might not be as good for us as we first thought. However, many organisations, including the British Heart Foundation, have come out to dispel the misconception. It turns out that cholesterol in food has a negligible effect on one’s blood cholesterol levels. Instead, it is far more important to watch out for saturated fats, which, fortunately, eggs don’t contain much of.'

So despite any concerns, you can still enjoy your eggs the sunny way.'

This meant infants, pregnant women and older people, who are vulnerable to infection, could finally eat raw eggs or foods containing them.'
