        text: 'In 1982, Wolfgang Puck opened Spago in Los Angeles, serving hand-rolled pasta with the best of California’s produce. It became an instant hit and has remained a firm favourite among A-listers ever since. Other celebrity chefs have also joined Puck to offer the best of farm-to-table New American fare in LA. As a result, there is a fantastic string of fine-dining restaurants that you can go to for a splurge-worthy meal.'

The portion is always generous, coffee is bottomless, and the décor is largely no-fuss – think tables with Formica tops, or if they are really battered, the waitress will spread out a chequered tablecloth to hide all sins.'

Today, there are more than a dozen outlets serving the greater LA area, all offering the limited menu (featuring hamburger, cheeseburger, double-double, and fries) just like when it first opened. Then there are the six ‘variations’ of hamburgers on the supposedly secret menu – ok, they aren’t top secrets now, but they still add a mysterious edge to the brand’s fame.'
